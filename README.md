# Enigma_Machine
A Python Tkinter approach to making an Enigma Machine used during WW2 Days.


An Enigma Machine is a rotating cipher created by German Engineer Arthur Scherbius in 1918


## How To Use the Enigma Machine
### Encrypt your Message
1. First decide which words/ sentence you want to encrypt/slash decrypt. Say here the word is 
  > HELLO
2. Now We note down the cylinder positions before you start to encrypt/ slah decrypt your sentence. By default they are 'A' 'A' 'A'
3. Once you have Set the cylinder positions, start pressing each of the buttons representing the letters to be pressed and note down the corresponding encrypted letter which lights up in yellow, here the encryption being
> IQVXI

#### You have successfully encrypted your message using a basic Enigma Machine

1. Lets say the encrypted message you recieved was 
> IQVXI
2. Also the cylinder positions you know during encryption were 'A' 'A' 'A'
3. To Decrypt your message, you have to set the cylinder positions back to what they were during encryption, here to 'A' 'A' 'A'
4. Simply press the Encrypted message to get the decrypted output.
> HELLO

#### You have successfully decrypted your message using a basic Enigma Machine


## Interesting Facts about the original Enigma Machine and this version made by me
1. The original enigma machine had 150,738,274,937,250 possible states for the Enigma Machine to be set. This version as prepared by me can have a minimum of 52728 states on exchanging small values on the code.
2. The Plugboard was also an additional Encryption feature used in the Original Enigma Machine which is under development and will be released as soon as finished.

# Enjoy Encrypting And Decrypting!!!! :)
